## 2. Assembling the case
### Preparing the Switchplate
* Parts needed: Switchplate, PCB, m2x4mm Threaded inserts, m2x5mm Socket Head Screws, Washers, Gaskets
1. Place the switchplate with the standoffs facing up in the same suggested orientation it was printed in and place the PCB onto the switchplate as shown in the image below.
2. Using a soldering iron, insert the five m2x4mm threaded inserts into the switchplate at the blue highlighted spots in the image below.

3. After the inserts have cooled down, fasten the m2x5mm socket head screws with the washer as shown in the image below.

4. Place your gaskets of choice on the switchplate and assemble the PCB/Switchplate further with the controller and switches/keycaps of choice as shown in the image below.

### Preparing the Top Housing
* Parts needed: Top housing, m3x4mm Threaded Inserts, Template, Wrist Rest material, Tag Plate, Double Sided Tape
1. Place the tophousing face down and use a soldering iron to insert the seven m3x4mm threaded inserts at the blue highlighted spots in the image below.

### Preparing the Bottom Housing and assembling the case
* Parts needed: Bottom Housing, Stick on Feet, Top Housing, Assembled switchplate/PCB
1. Place the five stick on feet underneath the bottom housing. If you only have four stick on feet available for each side, skip the spot underneath the thumb cluster.
2. The case can now be assembled, place the switchplate with the gaskets on the bottom housing and while aligning the top housing, lower it in place. Use seven m3x5mm Socket Head Screws to fasten the top housing to the bottom housing. The case is now complete!
